# Project Knowledge Base: [YOUR PROJECT NAME]

<!--
  HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:

  This is the central reference for your project's notation, conventions,
  key variables, and design decisions. Fill in the tables below with YOUR
  project-specific content.

  Claude will read this file when creating or modifying project content,
  ensuring consistency across all materials.

  Tips:
  1. Start small — add entries as your project develops
  2. The "Anti-Pattern" column prevents recurring mistakes
  3. The Variables Database helps Claude understand your data
  4. Delete all HTML comments once you've customized
-->

**Purpose:** Centralized reference for notation, variable definitions, design decisions, and conventions. Read this FIRST before creating or modifying project content.

**Last Updated:** [DATE]
