\section{Trainee Candidates and Retention}

\subsection{Number of Positions Requested}

We request support for 3 predoctoral trainee slots annually for a 5-year project period.
This number reflects our capacity for high-quality mentorship while building a cohort
that enables peer learning and collaboration.

% TODO: Strengthen the justification — why 3 and not 2 or 4?
% Consider: faculty-to-student ratios, historical cohort sizes, peer learning benefits,
%   comparison to similar T32 programs

\subsection{Recruitment Strategy}

We will recruit outstanding predoctoral candidates committed to aging research careers
through:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item National advertising at economics and public policy PhD programs;
  \item Targeted outreach to underrepresented groups through AEA Summer Program, APPAM
    Diversity Initiative, and ASHEcon networks;
  \item Leveraging faculty connections at professional conferences;
  \item Coordination with O'Neill PhD admissions to identify applicants with aging
    research interests.
\end{enumerate}

% TODO: Describe the candidate pool more concretely:
%   - How many PhD students does O'Neill admit per year?
%   - How many have health economics interests?
%   - What is the historical applicant-to-admit ratio?
%   - Are there students from other IU departments who might be eligible?

\subsection{Selection Criteria}

Trainees will be selected based on:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Demonstrated interest in health economics and aging research, evidenced by prior
    coursework, research experience, or career goals;
  \item Strong quantitative preparation in economics, statistics, or related fields;
  \item Potential for independent research as assessed by faculty recommendations and
    research statements;
  \item Commitment to pursuing careers advancing NIA's mission in aging research.
\end{enumerate}

A holistic, multifactorial review process will consider research potential, career
trajectory, and diverse experiences beyond standardized metrics alone.

% TODO: Describe the selection process in more detail:
%   - Who reviews applications? (all three PDs? a committee?)
%   - What specific materials are reviewed?
%   - How are reappointment decisions made?
%   - What are the criteria for continuing vs. discontinuing support?

\subsection{Retention}

% TODO: This is a required element — the FOA asks for:
%   - Evidence-informed practices for sustaining scientific interests
%   - Tailored approaches recognizing trainee diversity
%
% Elements to describe:
%   - Regular progress meetings with mentors
%   - Cohort-building activities
%   - Milestone tracking through IDPs
%   - Support for trainees experiencing difficulties
%   - Connection to broader IU support services

\textit{[Retention plans to be written. The FOA asks for ``evidence-informed practices
for sustaining scientific interests'' and ``tailored retention approaches recognizing
trainee diversity.'']}
