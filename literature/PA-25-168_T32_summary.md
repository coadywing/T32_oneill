3. **RCR** is now scored as part of overall impact (not just noted)
4. **Electronic submission only** via ASSIST, Grants.gov Workspace, or institutional S2S
5. **All registrations** (SAM, UEI, eRA Commons, Grants.gov) must be complete before submission (allow 6+ weeks)
6. **Advisory Committee Plan** highly recommended (file as "Advisory_Committee.pdf")
7. **Data Tables** required but do not count toward 25-page limit
8. Domestic institutions only — no foreign components
